 Project Setup and Basics
This is a Next.js project set up as part of the alx-project-0x02-setup repository. The repository demonstrates the basics of setting up a Next.js project, including routing, API routes, and initial configuration.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
