 Project Setup and Basics

This is a **Next.js** project set up in the **alx-project-0x02-setup** repo. It demonstrates a basic Next.js setup with routing, API routes, and configuration.

## Getting Started

1. **Run the dev server**. Get your act together and run the command:

```bash
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev
# OR
pnpm dev
# OR
bun dev

- Open http://localhost:3000 to check if it’s working. If it’s not, fix it.

- Edit pages/index.tsx to start customizing. Don’t be lazy – the page auto-updates as you modify it.

- API routes are located in the pages/api/ folder. You can access them at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. Go ahead and edit pages/api/hello.ts.

- Note: Files in pages/api are API routes, not React pages. Don’t mix things up.

- Fonts are handled automatically by next/font. We’re using the Geist font from Vercel.
